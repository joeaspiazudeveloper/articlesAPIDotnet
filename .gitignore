# Entity Framework Core migrations history snapshot (NOT the migration files themselves)
# This file is generated in the Migrations folder and tracks the model snapshot,
# but it's typically ignored to prevent unnecessary conflicts, as migrations
# themselves handle the versioning. If you want to keep the full history of the snapshot
# then remove this line. For most teams, ignoring it is fine.
# Keep the actual migration files (*_*.cs and *.Designer.cs)
